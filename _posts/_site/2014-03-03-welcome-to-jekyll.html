<p>After monthsâ€™ delay, I finally continue to write the blog. Due to the shortage of money, I cannot afford an VPS, even if I share the rent with a friend. On the other hand, WordPress is a little bit clumsy for me. So I switch to the GitHub Pages. All the posts are safely stored on GitHub and I have no need to worry about the backup when VPS expires. Besides, the style is so simple and neat, which perfectly satisfies me. Everything looks great here.</p>

<p>I will find some valuable posts on my earlier blog and post here. Hope I can keep the blog rate at one post per week. Kill the procrastination!</p>
